# Interior Design Website

This is my first-ever project, a simple yet elegant interior design website showcasing modern interior, built using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on visual aesthetics rather than responsiveness.

## Features
- Clean and modern UI
- Showcases various furniture pieces
- Purely built with HTML & CSS (no frameworks or JavaScript)

## Note
This website is **not responsive** and is designed primarily for desktop viewing.
